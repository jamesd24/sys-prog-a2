Milestone 1:
  
  When you do not wait for the child thread to finish reading stdin
  the buffer printed by the parent thread could contain incorent information.
  
  You cannot recursevly lock and unlock a mutex in child threads. A new mutex
  will need to be used to wait for the enter key input from the child thread.
  
  I did not need to use a third mutex for the final exit of the process. 
  A simple approach involving a boolean to indicate if the single child 
  thread had finished and exited.
